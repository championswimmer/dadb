A Kotlin/Java library to connect directly to an Android device without an adb binary or an ADB server

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("dev.mobile:dadb:<version>")
}
```

### Example Usage

Connect to `emulator-5554` and install `apkFile`:

```kotlin
Dadb.create("localhost", 5555).use { dadb ->
    dadb.install(apkFile)
}
```

*Note: Connect to the odd adb daemon port (5555), not the even emulator console port (5554)*

### Discover a Device

Searches `localhost` ports `5555` through `5683` for a valid adb device:  

```kotlin
val dadb = Dadb.discover("localhost")
if (dadb == null) throw RuntimeException("No adb device found")
```

### Connecting to a physical device

#### Connect over Wi-Fi - Android 11+ (Wi-Fi Pairing)

1. Pair your device over wifi using the standard `adb pair HOST:PORT CODE` command ([docs](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#connect-to-a-device-over-wi-fi-android-11+)).
    * eg: `adb pair 10.0.0.192:45678 123456`
2. Tell your device to listen for connections on tcp port 5555.
    * `adb tcpip 5555`
4. Once your device is listening for connections on port 5555, dadb can connect to your device using your device's IP address (same as HOST above).
    * eg: `Dadb.connect(10.0.0.192, 5555)`.

#### Connect over Wi-Fi - Android 10 and below

1. Tell your device to listen for connections on tcp port 5555 ([docs](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#wireless)):
    * Connect your device via USB, then run `adb tcpip 5555`
2. Find you device's IP address. (See: [Step 6](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#wireless))
3. Connect to your device's IP address using dadb:
    * eg: `Dadb.connect(10.0.0.192, 5555)`

#### USB

Connections over USB are not currently supported.

### Install / Uninstall APK

```kotlin
dadb.install(exampleApkFile)
dadb.uninstall("com.example.app")
```

### Push / Pull Files

```kotlin
dadb.push(srcFile, "/data/local/tmp/dst.txt")
dadb.pull(dstFile, "/data/local/tmp/src.txt")
```

### Execute Shell Command

```kotlin
val response = dadb.shell("echo hello")
assert(response.exitCode == 0)
assert(response.output == "hello\n")
```

### TCP Forwarding

```kotlin
dadb.tcpForward(
    hostPort = 7001,
    targetPort = 7001
).use {
    // localhost:7001 is now forwarded to device's 7001 port
    // Do operations that depend on port forwarding
}
```

### Authentication

**Dadb will use your adb key at `~/.android/adbkey` by default. If none exists at this location, private and public keys will be generated by dadb.**

If you need to specify a custom path to your adb key, use the optional `keyPair` argument:

```kotlin
val adbKeyPair = AdbKeyPair.read(privateKeyFile, publicKeyFile)
Dadb.create("localhost", 5555, adbKeyPair)
```

## Development 

### Pre-requisites 

This project is made in Kotlin, and build with Gradle, thus to build `dadb` from source you'll need 

- JDK (1.8, 11 or 14) setup on your machine
- Gradle 7.2 (optional; this project can use gradle wrapper automatically too) 

### Building 

```shell
$ ./gradlew assemble # using the gradle wrapper script 
```
or
```shell
$ gradle assemble # using your local gradle distribution
```

### Running Tests 

You can run all tests using 

```shell 
$ ./gradlew check
```

> NOTE: Do remember that the unit tests need either an ADB-enabled device or emulator connected to your machine
